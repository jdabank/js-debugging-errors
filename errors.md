**Note:** The commented out code is part of the prompt. It represents code we've tried to implement to complete the function, and we may or may not need all or some of the commented out code in the final solution.

```js
function createSequence( max ) {
  let sequence = [1, 1]
  // a = 1
  // b = 1

  for (let i = 2; i < max; i++) {
  let a = sequence[i - 1]
  let b = sequence[i - 2]
  sequence.push(a + b)

  // while (i <= max) {
  //    var a = 1, b = 1

  return sequence
}

let sequence = createSequence(20)
console.log(sequence)
```
